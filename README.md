# FaceEmotionRecognition
Here we use to do face emotion recognition with the help of keras and opencv you can find code and preprocessing techniques


It is fully develpoed for Face Emotion recognition with help of the computer vision and CNN

# How to Use it?
To use this code just we need to install some packages from pypi library

# Prerequests **

    1.We need Python 3.x idle or Anaconda
    2.Need all the libraries 
      1.numpy
      2.matplotlib
      3.seaborn
      4.pandas
      5.opencv
      6.keras backend tensorflow

# How to install all the prerequests

Just run the below command

    sudo apt install -r requirements.txt
    or
    pip3 install requirements.txt
    
# How play with the model and the preprocessing code

Here if you are intered you can uodate the preprocessing code and the model also

# Working of the model

you can get the data from the this link https://drive.google.com/open?id=1sN0TtZ3LGTh2M15Zy-xB0tl1gGtfxtNT

# Model file 

you can model.hdf5 file from this link https://drive.google.com/open?id=1q29tJlE81i7dAToResbGMjszkLQE1V5j

# Running the model 

just open your CMD or Terminal
run this command
    
    python3 app.py
    
 after running the command you can see all the files like
 
    1.csv_data.csv
    2.foo.png
    3.bar.png
